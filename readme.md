Apophenia Aggregator

  Apophenia is the experience of applying a meaningful pattern to randomness. It's what happens when you see recongnizable shapes in clouds. It is a common occurence. The inkblot test designed by Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach is a famous expample of apophenia at work in an attempt to gain insight in to a patient's mind.
  
  While apophenia is usually harmless it is a type of bias that can in some forms disproportionately influence our peception. On this page I invite you to submit your interpretations of these classic Rorschach ink blots. Through the accumulation of a vast quantity of submissions I encourage visitors to search for trends in interpretations. What might we learn about ourselves at this moment in time by finding common interpretations? Can anything productive be taken away without falling victim to apophenia?


To Do: 
    If I receive the OK that changing delete to only deleting comments is OK I will do that first

    I did not implement a system for additional comments and replies. I would like to add that

    I think it would work better to present 3 - 5 images in a row for someone to respond to before redirecting to the past submissions page. Less chance for bias contamination from viewing others responses

    I would re-design the site for live as the gif backgrounds slow down load times and I took the gifs without permission. 

Wins:
    Successful implementation of math.random to pick image from db at random on page refresh

    Successfully sorted past submissions from newest to oldest using timestamp properties

    Piped images from starting collection to user comment collection using hidden form value
